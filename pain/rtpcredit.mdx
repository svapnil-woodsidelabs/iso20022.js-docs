The `RTPCreditPaymentInitiation` class is used to generate RTP Credit Payment Initiation messages. These are primarily used for real-time payment transfers within the United States banking system.

It can be created via the `RTPCreditPaymentInitiationConfig` interface.

## Constructor

```typescript
// Example Usage
const config: RTPCreditPaymentInitiationConfig = {
    initiatingParty: {
        name: 'Acme Corporation',
        id: 'ACMECORP',
        account: {
            accountNumber: '987654321098'
        },
        agent: {
            abaRoutingNumber: '122105155'
        }
    },
    paymentInstructions: [
        {
            type: 'rtp',
            direction: 'credit',
            amount: 100000, // $1000.00
            currency: 'USD',
            creditor: {
                name: 'All-American Dogs Co.',
                account: {
                    accountNumber: '123456789012',
                },
                agent: {
                    abaRoutingNumber: '37714568112',
                }
            },
            remittanceInformation: '1000 Hot Dogs Feb26',
        }
    ]
}

const rtp = new RTPCreditPaymentInitiation(config)
```

Initializes a new `RTPCreditPaymentInitiation` instance with the provided configuration.

## Methods

### serialize(): string

```typescript
const xmlString = rtp.serialize();
console.log(xmlString);
```

Serializes the `RTPCreditPaymentInitiation` instance into an XML string representation. The resulting XML string can be used to send the payment to the bank.

### toString(): string

Alias for `serialize()`.

## Validation

The class includes built-in validation to ensure the payment initiation data meets the required standards:

- Account numbers must be valid for US banking.
- ABA routing numbers must be valid and properly formatted.
- All payment instructions must have USD as the currency.
- Amount values should be specified in cents (e.g., 100000 for $1000.00).
